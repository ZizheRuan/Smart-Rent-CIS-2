This project is for IT Innovation Project in S1, 2018

Smart Rent project is a rental platform for university students in melbourne

Smart Rent team offers a review aggregator and platform to provide more information about rental properties.

Through Smart Rent, the customers are delivered a one-site solution for rental property finding, comparing and rating.

Our innovative product, Smart Rent, helps you to find a place to live, faster, smoother, and hassle-free.

We aim to provide university students a place to get the information they need at a glance,
rather than searching on different websites, copying the address and pasting to Google Map, and calculating the distance and the duration to their uni.

We aim to make students get rid of the hostile agents, bad landlords and properties with hidden defects.
Meanwhile, highlight the agents and landlords with good reputations, along with the satisfying properties.

Rate your agent, comment on your property, join our campaign to make the market transparent and fair! The code of this website is made public on GitHub to
offer a transparent rating mechanism.
